I need you to edit a section of text based on specific requirements.\n\nTASK:\nEdit the following section based on this request: Expand on Austria's motivations for going to war and their diplomatic efforts\n\nMAIN SECTION TO EDIT:\nTitle: Austria plans for war\nLines: 21-30\nCurrent content:\nAustria hoped Prussia would assist them in a war with France but a letter from Prussian minister Baron von Stein discussing the negotiations was intercepted by French agents and published in the Le Moniteur Universel on 8 September. Napoleon confiscated Stein's holdings in Westphalia and pressured King Frederick William III into dismissing him, and Stein fled into exile in Austria.\n\nOn the same day that Stein was compromised the Convention of Paris agreed a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Prussia, where French garrisons had been in place since the end of the War of the Fourth Coalition. The withdrawal was contingent on the payment of heavy reparations, totalling 140 million francs, over 30 months. The Prussian Army was also limited in size to 42,000 men, one sixth of its pre-war total. The convention severely restricted the ability of the Prussian state to wage war.\n\nFrance withdrew 108,000 troops from Germany, more than half their strength there, to reinforce the French armies in Spain in October 1808. This lent support to Stadion's pro-war faction at the Austrian court. Stadion recalled Klemens von Metternich, his ambassador to Paris, to convince others to support his plan and by December 1808 Emperor Francis I was persuaded to support the war.\n\nAustria and Prussia requested that Britain fund their military campaigns and requested a British military expedition to Germany. In April 1809 the British treasury supplied £20,000 in credit to Prussia, with additional funds promised if Prussia opened hostilities with France. Austria received £250,000 in silver, with a further £1 million promised for future expenses. Britain refused to land troops in Germany but promised an expedition to the low countries and to renew their campaign in Spain.\n\nCONTEXT:\nThe following context is relevant for the edit:\n\nPeninsular War (lines 11-20):\nProvides information on Austria's involvement in the Peninsular War, which may have influenced their decision to go to war.\n\nBackground (lines 1-30):\nOffers a broader context that may explain the factors leading to Austria's decision to go to war.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n1.
