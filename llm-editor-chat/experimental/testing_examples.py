SAMPLE_MARKDOWN_HOARD = """# William Dempster Hoard

William Dempster Hoard (October 10, 1836 – November 22, 1918) was an American politician, newspaper publisher, and agriculture advocate who was the 16th governor of Wisconsin from 1889 to 1891. Called the "father of modern dairying", Hoard's advocacy for scientific agriculture and the expansion of dairy farming has been credited with changing Wisconsin's agricultural economy. He promoted the use of silos and alfalfa for cattle feed, testing for bovine tuberculosis, and raising particular breeds of cattle for milk or meat in his magazine *Hoard's Dairyman*. His work with the Wisconsin Dairymen's Association led to the export of Wisconsin dairy products to the East Coast, and they earned national renown.

As editor of his newspaper, the *Jefferson County Union*, Hoard defied trends of the time for small newspapers by expanding the coverage area of the paper and including a strongly voiced editorial page, which he used to advocate for improved farming practices and dairy farming. As governor of Wisconsin, Hoard established the Dairy and Food Commission—one of the first food inspection agencies in the United States—and signed a controversial, short-lived compulsory education law that required all students in the state to be taught in English as part of the Americanization process for immigrants.

## Early Life and Education

William D. Hoard was born on October 10, 1836, in Munnsville, New York, to William Bradford Hoard and Sarah Katherine White Hoard. He was the eldest of four children. His father was a blacksmith and itinerant Methodist minister who preached to the Oneida people. Hoard was educated in a one-room log schoolhouse built by his grandfather, Enos, who also maintained a library. The library and encouragement from Hoard's mother led to a passion for reading. Enos brought Hoard while purchasing dairy cattle and educated him on dairy farming as a child. When he was 16, Hoard left school to work as a farmhand for Waterman Simons, a neighboring dairy farmer from whom Hoard learned how to make cheese and butter. While working as a farmhand, Hoard witnessed the depletion of New York soil by the growing of wheat and other crops, which led to the adoption of dairy farming in the state. During this time, he managed a 50-cow herd and read technical journals on farming.

In 1857, Hoard moved to Oak Grove, Wisconsin, and studied to become a Methodist minister. Ideological conflict with church leadership led him to cease his studies. For the next three years, Hoard found employment chopping wood and giving singing lessons. In 1860, he married Agnes Elizabeth Bragg and moved in with her parents in Lake Mills, Wisconsin. The couple had three children: Halbert Louis, Arthur Ralph, and Frank Ward.

After the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hoard—an admirer of Abraham Lincoln—enlisted in the Union Army. He was assigned to the 4th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment as a fife player and participated in the capture of New Orleans. Hoard became ill while pursuing Confederate soldiers and was discharged. He returned to his parents' farm in New York; after fully recovering, he re-enlisted in the Union Army and was assigned to Battery A of the 1st New York Light Artillery Battalion, serving until the end of the war in 1865. After the war, Hoard moved to Columbus, Wisconsin, and attempted to grow hops. The price of the crop collapsed, and Hoard gave up hop farming.

## Career

### Publishing and Advocacy

#### *Jefferson County Union* and *Hoard's Dairyman*

Hoard founded a weekly newspaper, the *Jefferson County Union*, in Lake Mills in 1870. Against the trends of the time, Hoard expanded his paper's coverage to include surrounding areas. Early editions of the *Union* were printed under contract with the *Watertown Republican*, for which Hoard had written before founding his own newspaper. Hoard moved the *Union* to Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, in 1873 and by 1883 he had constructed a new building that included a printing press.

Hoard included an editorial page in the *Union*, a rarity for small newspapers of the time. He used these columns to write about a variety of topics, most prominently the promotion of scientific agricultural practices, and started a dairy farming-specific column in 1872. Readers received these editorials with skepticism due to Hoard's lack of experience in Wisconsin agriculture, and referred to him as a theorist and a "book farmer". Hoard continued to write agriculture columns and, after encouragement from his son Arthur and *Whitewater Register* publisher Ed E. Coe, founded *Hoard's Dairyman* in 1885 as a folio supplement to the *Union*.

The *Dairyman* was initially financially supported by its parent newspaper. By 1889, it had become a separate magazine that focused primarily on dairy farming. As was commonplace with dairy trade publications at the time, Hoard mixed reporting and advertising in the *Dairyman*, juxtaposing advertisements with articles promoting the advertised technique or technology. Hoard used the publication to advocate for agricultural and dairy manufacturing practices, including:

- Testing herds for bovine tuberculosis and providing recompense for culled animals
- Promoting alfalfa as cattle feed
- Advocating for the use of particular cattle breeds for milking or meat
- Promoting the Babcock test for butterfat content
- Sanitizing milk bottles used in city delivery
- Promoting humane treatment of cattle
- Encouraging formation of agricultural cooperatives
- Promoting the use of silos for cattle feed storage

Hoard purchased *Hoard's Dairyman Farm* in 1899 to test agricultural theories. By 1924, *Hoard's Dairyman* had a circulation of 75,000 and readers in Japan, Australia, and England. It is considered the first agriculture publication to have a nationwide readership in the U.S.

### Trade Associations and Lobbying

Hoard founded the Jefferson County Dairymen's Association in 1871 and co-founded the Wisconsin Dairymen's Association (WDA) in 1872. The WDA aimed to:

1. Discuss dairy problems
2. Eliminate cheese surplus and reduce freight rates
3. Market to East Coast dealers

Hoard successfully negotiated lower rail rates and refrigerated cars for cheese transport, spurring Wisconsin’s cheese industry. In 1876, the WDA independently exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition, earning 20 national awards.

The WDA and Hoard lobbied for legislation to:

- Ban skim and filled cheese
- Establish farmers' institutes and the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin
- Create the first U.S. dairy school in 1890

Hoard also opposed the sale of adulterated dairy products and oleomargarine. He founded the National Dairy Union in 1894 and lobbied for an additional tax on colored oleomargarine, culminating in the Oleomargarine Act of 1902.

## Political Career

### Early Career

In 1870, Hoard was appointed deputy U.S. Marshal and census taker. The experience shaped his later education policy. He was also named sergeant-at-arms for the Wisconsin Senate in 1872.

### Governor of Wisconsin

In 1888, Hoard was unanimously nominated as the Republican candidate for governor. He won the election and served from 1889 to 1891. As governor, he:

- Established the Dairy and Food Commission
- Enforced bans on adulterated dairy products
- Passed a controversial English-only compulsory education law

### Bennett Law

The Bennett Law, signed in April 1889, required children aged 7–14 to attend school and receive instruction in English. It sparked fierce opposition from German Catholic and Lutheran communities, who saw it as an attack on their parochial schools and culture.

Despite support from some immigrant communities, the law was highly controversial. In the 1890 election, Democrats swept the legislature, and Hoard lost the governorship. The law was repealed in 1891. However, it indirectly led parochial schools to increase English instruction voluntarily.

## Post-Governorship

After his defeat, Hoard resumed work on his publications and initially supported Robert M. La Follette. He later distanced himself from La Follette’s progressivism. Hoard served on the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents from 1907 to 1911, helping to build agricultural infrastructure. He resigned due to political conflicts.
